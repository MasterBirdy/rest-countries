# REST Countries Viewer

An Vue app that pulls country data using the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu), lets you sort them by name and region, and gives specific data about each country such as bordering countries. This was a front-end project challenge by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) in which I had to replicate the design specification as closely as possible (which can be seen in the design folder).
